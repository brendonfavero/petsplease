	<ul class="checklist" style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<li>We offer a quick search form on the front page for you to enter keywords to search.</li>
		<li>We offer an Advanced Search page for you to refine your search criteria.</li>
		<li>We offer browsing filters when you are browsing by category.</li>
		<li>If you already know what you are looking for you can browse the categories listed on the left side of the site's pages.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 class="subtitle">Can I save items to revisit later?</h1>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px;">Yes. You can maintain your own "favourites" list within your account. Each listing on
	our site has an "add to favourites" link.  Simply click that link and we will add that item to your favourites list. </p>
	
	<h1 class="subtitle">What if I can't find what I am looking for?</h1>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px;">You can set up search filters within your account area. Our site will
	then screen all new listings, as they are placed on the site, and if an item is listed that meets 
	your filter (search) criteria, we will automatically send you an email notification. </p>
	
	<h1 class="subtitle">How do buyers and sellers communicate with each other? </h1>
	<p style="padding: 0 15px;">We provide buyers with the ability to contact the seller through a form that is
	accessible on each of the seller's listing pages. The seller will then be notified by email of the buyer's 
	questions and the seller can either reply by email or log in to their account and reply through our onsite
	messaging system. The seller can choose to keep their email address anonymous.</p>
