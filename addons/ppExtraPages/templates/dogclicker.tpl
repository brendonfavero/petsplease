<h1>DOGS PLEASE CLICKER TRAINING</h1>
<br/>
What a great way to start a brand new year by learning how to train your dog in a kind and positive manner. We are excited to bring to our users Dogs Please Clicker Training for FREE! Register by 20 March 2015 and you will receive a FREE clicker prior to our step by step 12 week online program commencing 1 April 2015. Limited clickers available so be quick!
 <br/><br/>
Each week you will receive your training notes by email to complete during the week. You will have the chance to ask questions and comment on the week and there will be plenty of giveaways for your fury friend during the program.
 <br/><br/>
The next few weeks are going to show you the best approach when teaching your dog anything new, show you how he learns and help you to teach basic commands whilst also helping you to understand how your dog interprets everything in his life. From good understanding comes great dog training and from kind communication comes excellent canine behaviour.
 <br/><br/>
Whether you have a new puppy or an older dog you will benefit from this learning opportunity. We look forward to the next few weeks and to seeing your shared experiences when you play the games that we include, this is going to be fun!
 <br/><br/>
We look forward to seeing your progress and share photo's along the way.
