with the license.  It is recommended to keep this addon installed for the first 
few weeks, to make sure everything is going smoothly.  It will let you know of any
license problems that might be slowing down your site.<br />
<br />
Like any logging addon, keeping this addon enabled will add some overhead to 
every page load.  Once you are sure that everything is going smoothly with the
license validation, you should disable this addon to increase site performance, 
especially on a high traffic site.';

/* CHANGELOG
 * 
 * v1.1.0 -- Geo 5.0.0
 *  - Changed pagination to match the new admin design
 *  - Oops we don't update the version number since this is a core addon that
 *    does not need update script to be run, so version kept at 1.0
